		<h1>I think you're really cool</h1>
		<p>
			[Intro]
			<br>1, 2
			<br>1, 2, 3, 4
			<br>
			<i>Hey, it's, it's just me again and I.. I wanted to call you, and share a song that I'm working on, but I... I guess you're busy so call me back when you get a chance.. ah..yeah; huh...
			<br>I love you, bye</i>
			<br>
			<br>[Verse 1]
			<br>This song brings on the weather, teardrops upon my sweater
			<br>I cry in bed whenever, I see you guys together
			<br>Fuck love it's all a lie, I, can't sleep I'd rather die
			<br>Than see that look in your eye
			<br>It sucks that I'm not your guy, but
			<br>
			<br>[Chorus]
			<br>I think you're really cool like
			<br>I think you're really cool like
			<br>Yeah, I think you're really cool like
			<br>Yeah, I think you're really cool like
			<br>
			<br>[Verse 2]
			<br>I packed my bags last week, sunrise and I'm on my feet
			<br>Let's skip town and chase our dreams, 'cause this place ain't what it seems, so
			<br>Come home, let's synchronize, my, soft lips caress your thighs
			<br>You, get me so fucking high, the, voices in my head collide, and
			<br>
			<br>[Chorus]
			<br>I think you're really cool like (I think you're really cool like)
			<br>I think you're really cool like (I think you're really cool like)
			<br>Yeah, I think you're really cool like (I think you're really cool like)
			<br>Yeah, I think you're really cool like
			<br>
			<br>[Outro]
			<br>(Beep)
			<br>Keep your voice down, she don't care no
			<br>I can't breathe I've got no air, no sympathy for my despair
			<br>I cut my wrists and grow my hair
			<br>I'm outta my mind (Out of my mind, yeah)
			<br>I'm outta my mind (Out of my mind, yeah, yeah)
			<br>I think I'm outta my mind
			<br>I think I'm outta my mind
			<br>I think I'm outta my mind
			<br>I think I'm outta my mind
			<br>I think I'm outta my mind
