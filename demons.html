		<h1>Demon in my Orbit</h1>
		<p>[Intro]
	<br>
	<i>
	They keep telling me to love myself
	<br>How the fuck do you love yourself
	<br>When you don't even know
	<br>Who the fuck you are anymore?
	<br>Like you feel like you're reaching your breaking point
	<br>Every fucking day and it's just...
	<br>It's hard, man
	</i><br>
	<br>[Hook]
	<br>They don't wanna talk
	<br>They don't wanna feel
	<br>The voices in my head saying
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>They don't wanna talk
	<br>They don't wanna feel
	<br>The voices in my head saying
	<br>I don't think I'm
	<br>They don't wanna talk
	<br>They don't wanna feel
	<br>The voices in my head saying
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>I don't think I'm (yeah)
    <br>[Verse]
    <br>I don't know where my heads been at
    <br>And I've been feeling like a nuisance just because of that
    <br>It's like a headache but the funny thing about it's that
	<br>The pain won't go away till my brain go splat
	<br>And I've been trying to decode myself, figure my shit out
	<br>Get a better grip and spark the spliff that's in my mouth
	<br>I can't cope without the dope and time's just runnin' out
	<br>Losin' my patience, I'm vacant, a hollow body now
	<br>I'm finding other ways to try to cope with all the pain
	<br>And if I'm being honest with you, baby I am not okay
	<br>The fucking voice inside my head is driving me insane
	<br>And silence kills me, lately it just hasn't been the same
	<br>Lost in my head, lost in my mind
	<br>Telling myself that I'll be just fine
	<br>Nothing's okay and nothing's alright
	<br>Smoking all day, crying all night
	<br>And what the fuck you expect from the kid
	<br>I got demons in my orbit that I'm tryin' to rid
	<br>Of all the shit that I deal with, I act on a whim
	<br>I'm like a fish outta water trying to swim, ah
	<br>Bedroom dweller, I'm feelin' so fucking stellar
	<br>When I empty my clip into the chest of the teller
	<br>Killed the man inside of me that's been lane switchin' better
	<br>Grab the 9, grip the trigger, this my suicide letter
	<br>
	<br>[Hook]
	<br>They don't wanna talk
	<br>They don't wanna feel
	<br>The voices in my head saying
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>They don't wanna talk
	<br>They don't wanna feel
	<br>The voices in my head saying
	<br>I don't think I'm
	<br>They don't wanna talk
	<br>They don't wanna feel
	<br>The voices in my head saying
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>I don't think I'm real
	<br>I don't think I'm
