				<p>
				I personally listened to him for a real long time from 2013.  He has done countless collaboration with many others personal favorites and other singers from 9tails, Yung Van, guccihighwaters, and flowars. He first started off with some mellow beats, but as time past on he starts to rap/sing with them. His most popular album, Lacuna, is his album which gain his fame, and the start of his tours and music life. He is very supportive with his fan base, and he has many social media platform from Instagram to Twitter, and three music platform; Spotify, Soundcloud, and Apple Music. He has many merch with many of his albums. His motto, or rather favorite quote is "make your dreams your reality." Guardin is one of my favorite singer, he doesn't really i would say inspire me, but rather make me happy about he feels the same way we (listeners) feels.
