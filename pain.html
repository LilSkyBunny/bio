		<h1>Take Away the Pain</h1>
			<p>[Intro]
				<br>So you be kind
				<br>And I will take you back through time
				<br>I will take away the pain, Mary
				<br>So you be kind
				<br>And I will take you back through time
				<br>I will take away the pain, Mary
				<br>
				<br>
				[Verse]
				<br>I'm just fine wasting all my life online
				<br>I've been tracing all these faces of mine
				<br>And I'm okay, think I've lost my sense of pain
				<br>Suffering inside my brain tonight
				<br>I don't think they really care
				<br>I'm breathing but ain't got no air
				<br>The room is spinning over there
				<br>Put my life in a fucking square
				<br>I'm hopeless and I know it's true
				<br>Loving me ain't possible
				<br>I'm trippin' over obstacles
				<br>And melting like a Popsicle
				<br>You call me but I dodge your call
				<br>Antisocial protocol
				<br>Imma land before I fall
				<br>Even if I have to crawl
				<br>Even if I gotta write a line about the time I saw
				<br>Demons in the rear view of the whip and now I feel it all
				<br>
				<br>
				[Pre-Chorus]
				<br>Imma runaway
				<br>It's just what I do all day
				<br>Gotta get the fuck away
				<br>Obviously I'm the problem cause I think about your face
				<br>When you ghostin' I'm proposin' that we fall back into place
				<br>
				<br>[Chorus]
				<br>I take away, I'd take away the pain
				<br>I'd take away, I take away, I'd take away the pain
				<br>(So you be kind<br>And I will take you back through time<br>I will take away the pain, Mary)
				<br>I take away, I'd take away the pain
				<br>I'd take away, I take away, I'd take away the pain
				<br>
				<br>[Outro]
				<br>I'd take away, I take away, I'd take away the pain
				<br>I'd take away, just take away
			</p>
