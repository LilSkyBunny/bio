		<p>[Hook]<br>Baby, baby you da one that saved me
			<br>And I don't know where the f*ck I'd be
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>Baby, baby you da one that saved me
			<br>And I don't know where the f*ck I'd be
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>
			<br>[Verse 1]
			<br>I think of you when I wake up, wake up
			<br>When I dream, I'm just hopin' I don't wake up
			<br>The demons in my head dressed like angels in their make up, make up
			<br>Paints a picture of these feelings that are made up
			<br>I'm feelin' like a lost f*ckin' cause when they jabbin' at me
			<br>And these scars never fade with my anxiety
			<br>Grip the knife in my back and remove it quickly
			<br>Then it's off with my head cause it's lost in the sea
			<br>I feel okay, yeah now I'm feelin' fine
			<br>When our lips touch and our fingers intertwine
			<br>So much love for you baby, you are my sunshine
			<br>You relieve all the tings that I wanna leave behind
			<br>I never felt okay until I met you
			<br>You've been tacklin' these rain clouds and shiftin' all my hues
			<br>No way is there a dull second when you in the room
			<br>Got me laughin' like a hyena trippin' on shrooms
			<br>
			<br>[Hook]
			<br>Baby, baby you da one that saved me
			<br>And I don't know where the f*ck I'd be
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>Baby, baby you da one that saved me
			<br>And I don't know where the f*ck I'd be
			<br>If it wasn't you and me<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>
			<br>[Verse 2]
			<br>Maybe it's the way you call my name
			<br>Maybe it's the serotonin in my brain
			<br>Baby, we gon' fly away
			<br>Paintin' pictures of our perfect hideaway
			<br>It's alright if you wanna get away
			<br>Baby, we can get away to a place where nobody knows us
			<br>Where the grass is always green and the roses coat us
			<br>I can't concentrate with you here so I'm sippin' zonas
			<br>Tryna hide the f*ckin' pain hopin' you don't notice
			<br>But you do and I just hate the way I lie about
			<br>All the negativity in my head spewin' like a water spout
			<br>The way you make me feel is incredible, there's no doubt
			<br>So baby take me to your place so we can just lie around
			<br>And when I kiss your face
			<br>It's another f*ckin' realm, new time, new space
			<br>Baby girl, you know I've been tryin', pickin' up the pace
			<br>Reassemblin' my cerebellum, tell em what to chase
			<br>
			<br>[Hook]
			<br>Baby, baby you da one that saved me
			<br>And I don't know where the f*ck I'd be
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>Baby, baby you da one that saved me
			<br>And I don't know where the f*ck I'd be
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
			<br>If it wasn't you and me
