		<h1>FOREVER</h1>
		<p>
			I find it hard to find myself in the mist
			<br>Fighting off these fucking demons with a blunt on my fist
			<br>Peroxide is the queen
			<br>Alcohol is the prince
			<br>Yours truly is a (?) giving (?)
			<br>
			<br>No fucking bandages can fix this lonely stoner
			<br>I'm a pilot in a world full of lives without an owner
			<br>Tryna find an empty vessel
			<br>Maybe I could be a donor
			<br>(?)
			<br>Sitting gracefully and waiting your arrival
			<br>I'm kidding
			<br>I'm fucking anxious, in desperate need of revival
			<br>I'm sorry that I'm so broken
			<br>You make me less suicidal
			<br>A panic switch in the distance but yet
			<br>You remain idle, I love you
			<br>More than I probably should
			<br>I mean my heart is heavy for you
			<br>Heavier than the wood
			<br>Holding everything together right above where we stood
			<br>But now I never mind, don't tell me that you're up to no good
			<br>
			<br>Even though you're probably sittin' there and studying for your classes
			<br>I'm thinking 'bout all the dudes you'll probably be fucking smashin'
			<br>I'm laughing
			<br>'Cause every problem solely exist in my atlas
			<br>My vision was 20/20 but now I think I need glasses
			<br>This blurry life's got me caught up in a net
			<br>Sun shining on me but my state of mind is not connect
			<br>I just wanna free myself from these thoughts full of regret
			<br>Can you please bring my walls down so I can just reset
			<br>Fuck
			<br>
			<br>Listening to you talk is my forte
			<br>The way you structure your sentences is just so gourmet
			<br>And when I see the way you walk in through that doorway
			<br>I'm picturing my head between your legs on some foreplay
			<br>I'm kissing blunts not kissing sluts, don't worry bo
			<br>The last thing I wanna do is make you worry too
			<br>'Cause honestly that will probably be the death of you
			<br>Surviving on my own is impossible
			<br>You ain't got a clue
			<br>
			<br>And when I step up in the ride
			<br>I find my mind contemplate suicide
			<br>I try to hide this side
			<br>'Cause I know you don't wanna abide
			<br>To these dark thoughts that I confine
			<br>But I'm alive
			<br>'Cause someone told me I'm more than what meets the eye
			<br>She's the fallin' cherry blossoms in my cotton candy sky
			<br>A bullet can leave a rifle ending everything that I
			<br>Have stumbled over to get here, I'm simply more than a guy, I
			<br>
			<br>I'm high
			<br>Got me feelin' so high
			<br>My lil' mango an' I
			<br>Forever goes through my mind
